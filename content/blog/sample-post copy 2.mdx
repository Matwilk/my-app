# Building a Music Visualization App with React and Web Audio API

As both a software engineer and musician, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of these two fields. In this post, I'll walk through how I built a real-time music visualization application using React and the Web Audio API.

## The Inspiration

During one of my recent travels to Tokyo, I visited a digital art exhibition that featured incredible audio-responsive installations. This inspired me to create something similar that I could share online.

## Technical Implementation

The Web Audio API provides a powerful system for controlling audio on the web, offering the ability to select audio sources, add effects, create visualizations, and more.

Here's a simplified example of how to create an audio analyzer:

```javascript
// Create audio context
const audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();

// Create analyzer
const analyser = audioContext.createAnalyser();
analyser.fftSize = 2048;

// Get data
const bufferLength = analyser.frequencyBinCount;
const dataArray = new Uint8Array(bufferLength);
analyser.getByteTimeDomainData(dataArray);
```

Stay tuned for a follow-up post where I'll dive deeper into the visualization techniques!
